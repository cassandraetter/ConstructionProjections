# Inclusion and Wellbeing Projections

This is the fourth tranche of work which builds on the indicators related to wellbeing and inclusion.

Overview: Data for GlobalABC Project on construction and building indicators and projections
This is the repository containing the source code and documentation for the Global ABC baseline assessment and indicators and projections for gap analysis. 
The point of the project is to 
1) gain a good understanding of the context 
2) identify challenges and opportunities and 
3) measure the objective achievement gap. 

The project was carried out by UNOPS.
